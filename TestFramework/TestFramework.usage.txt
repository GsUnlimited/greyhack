To use this Framework you first need to make a new Testcase(1 Testcase each file you want to test)
to do this do the following:
yourTestCaseName = "TheName"
yourVariable = new Testcase.constructor(yourTestCaseName)

After this is done you can use this object for everything else
every Assertion has minimum 2 parameters: 
    - The thing you want to test also called _input
    - The Description for this test
Your _input has a wide possible range depending on which method you use
Your Description should always contain the names of your variables so you can differ between your tests.
A pattern like: "test if true is true" or "test if true is not true" is recommended(exept of true use your variableNames and what you want to test).

if you got any Questions let me know
And yes you can basically test everything with this(List and Map stuff will be coming)
